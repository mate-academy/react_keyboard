# React Keyboard

> [React + Typescript cheat sheet](https://mate-academy.github.io/fe-program/js/extra/react-typescript)

Make the `App` a class component with `pressedKey` in the `state`.

- before any key was pressed show a `Nothing was pressed yet` message;
- when a key is pressed show a `The last pressed key is <event.key>` message;
- use `componentDidMount` to add `keyup` handler:

    ```js
    document.addEventListener('keyup', (event: KeyboardEvent) => {
      console.log(event.key);
    });
    ```

- use `removeEventListener` to remove a global handler in `componentWillUnmount`.
